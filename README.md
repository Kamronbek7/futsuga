## 🔑 Protection system (DRM-like)

Futsuga gives you author control like `PDF` files:

- `readonly` – code can be viewed, but not modified
- `viewonly` – only viewed, not executable
- `runonly` – only runable, code hidden
- `signed` – RSA signature protected file

---

## ⚙️ Example: A simple `.futs` file

```futsuga
commands:
/start: "Hello, welcome to the bot!"
```

---

## Suggestions
If you have suggestions, you can send them to the [/invites](/invites) directory as *pull request* in .pdf, .docx or .txt format. Please, it would be easier if the language name in the file name was `en` or `uz`. For example, invites_1828_uz.docx. You can also send example suggestions to the [/Examples](/Examples/) directory.

Thank you for your understanding.

## What does "Futsuga" mean?
I'll write it clearly: nothing. Just "**Futsuga**" (other names are taken).
This name has nothing to do with Japanese or Chinese.
