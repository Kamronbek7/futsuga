- However, if you collect funds as an NGO, this will not cause legal problems.
- If you are building a bot development platform, Futsuga can be used in a small part of the project (30% or less).
- Telegram bots can be used for any commercial purpose unrelated to it.

These restrictions and possibilities do not apply to the assets, invites, Examples jids in the Futsuga source code.
